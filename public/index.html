      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      Gian Gyger - Full Stack Web/App Developer
    </h1>
    <p style="visibility: hidden; position: absolute;">
      I'm a Full Stack Web/App Developer based in Zurich, Switzerland. I develop
      Web-Applications with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, React,
      NodeJS, MongoDB, Django and Mobile App Development for iOS and Android
      using Swift and Java. At 11 years old i started coding by simply following
      Youtube tutorials e.g about how to clone Flappy Birds. This was the first
      app I wrote. I did it using Objective C in Xcode on my mother's laptop. It
      was really satisfying to see it working on my own iPod Touch 4th
      generation which was running iOS 5. A bit later I really started coding on
      my own by watching Java courses online and reading books about it. After I
      knew the core principles of programming well enough I started trying new
      languages and new fields of programming. I now have 4 years of programing
      experience. I have made Desktop Applications with Java, published my own
      Mobile Apps in the Play Store, built many Websites and Web Applications
      with frameworks like React and even done some Machine Learning/AI stuff
      like building simple neural networks with python.
